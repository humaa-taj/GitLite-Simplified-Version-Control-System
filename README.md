# GitLite - Simplified Version Control System

GitLite is a lightweight, educational version control system that mimics the core functionalities of Git while demonstrating advanced data structure and algorithm implementation techniques. This project was developed as part of a 3rd-semester Data Structures course to showcase mastery over concepts such as AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, and custom-built libraries, all while avoiding the use of dynamic memory or built-in libraries. The entire project operates file-based, ensuring persistence and efficient management of data on the hard disk.

## Features

### Version Control Functionalities
- **Repository Management**: Create and initialize repositories.
- **Branching**: Manage branches for version isolation.
- **Update and Delete**: Handle file updates and deletions within repositories.
- **Commit Tracking**: Maintain a log of commits and changes.

### Data Structures
- **AVL Trees**: Efficient handling of ordered data for fast retrieval.
- **Red-Black Trees**: Balanced tree structure for enhanced performance.

### Unique Aspects
- **File-Based System**: All data operations are handled using files on the hard disk, eliminating the need for dynamic memory.
- **Custom Libraries**: No reliance on standard libraries, including the string library. All functionality is implemented from scratch.
- **CSV File Handling**: Efficient parsing and management of large CSV files.

---

## Technical Highlights
- **No Dynamic Memory Usage**: All data management is handled through file I/O operations, demonstrating a deep understanding of low-level data handling.
- **Custom String Library**: Built from scratch, showcasing the ability to create fundamental utilities without external dependencies.
- **Persistent Data**: Leveraging file-based storage ensures data integrity and long-term persistence.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports efficient handling of large datasets with custom-built data structures.
